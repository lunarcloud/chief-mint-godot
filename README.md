# Chief Mint: Godot Achievements

![Addon Icon](icon.png)

This Godot 3 add-on helps you define, track, and display in-game achievements.

"Local File Storage" achievements are good for an self-distributed or Itch release, where there is no platform-native system.

Other platforms, such as Steam, should be easy to implement (Pull-Requests welcomed) - you just need to extend "ChiefMintSource".
